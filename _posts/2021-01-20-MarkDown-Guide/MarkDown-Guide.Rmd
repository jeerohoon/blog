### Important Features

#### Emphasis

1. Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
- I just love **bold text**.
- I just love __bold text__.

2. Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
- Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
- Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
- A*cat*meow

3. Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.
- This text is ***really important***.
- This text is ___really important___.	
- This text is __*really important*__.	
- This text is **_really important_**.
- This is really***very***important text.

#### Emphasis

1. Blockquotes 
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

2. Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

3. Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

4. Blockquotes with Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

#### Images

1. From image file
To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title after the URL in the parentheses.

![Test image!](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-01-20-MarkDown-Guide/testimage.jpg "Beach")

2. From link
To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

#### Reference-style Links

Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.

In one example, researchers studied the covid 
[@bastard_autoantibodies_2020].
