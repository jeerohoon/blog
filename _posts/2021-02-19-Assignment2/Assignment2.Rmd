## 1. Overview

The data 

- Original chart

![Figure0 : Original visualisation](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/Original.png)


The original source of the data can be found at [Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker)

In this GitHub page, below information and data files were used for analysis.

- [README.md](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/README.md)
- codebook of the core questionnaire [codebook.xlsx](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/codebook.xlsx)
- list of countries with data [countries.csv](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/countries.csv)
- individual country files with respondent-level data [data/country-name.csv](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/tree/master/data)


## 2. Critiques of the graph

### 2.1. Clarity

- spelling bistake: vaccination

#### 1) Missing graphs for illustration
  + The explanation above this chart illustrates four big things: (1) the share of residents population, (2) LFPR(Labour Force Prticipation Rate), (3) share of resident labour force, (4) Median age of residents. However, information of (3) and (4) is displayed in the chart and other two are merely stated in words. 
  + Especially, (1) the share of residents population by age is mentioned only with footnotes, so it is difficult to understand and match the other data. Also, LFPR graph is not shown in this chart, so understanding the trend of changes of LFPR is difficult.

#### 2) Missing data for comparison
  + To compare the data accurately, all the data sets should be ready for use. Closely looking into LFPR data set (Table 5), LFPR of 55 & over age group data does not exist. Therefore, we cannot use the figures of 55 & over age group to compare with the share of residents population. To make all the data sets in the same format, the share of residents population data set should be divided into four age groups, 15-24, 25-54, 55-64, and 65&over. 
 
#### 3) Inappropriate usage of graph
 + The median age of residents data between two years(2009 and 2019) are being displayed with dotted lines. However, because the figures of median age are continuous values, putting the dotted lines on categorical variables (age groups) is inappropriate.

### 2.2. Aesthetics

#### 1) Selection of graph 
 + In this chart, line graphs are used to show changes of the share of resident labour force by age. However, it is hard to understand how amounts of the share among the age groups were changed. 


#### 2) Highlighting of important message
 + In order to make readers understand easier, at least this chart needs to highlight important figures to deliever clearer message. 
 + Even the table bellow the line graphs show that the figures of the share of each age group, readers can not easily sum up the figures to evaluate the differences between two fiscal years.

#### 3) Labelling and captions
 + "June 20xx" labels are inserted multiple times unnecessarily. The duplicated labels can be removed to make the chart much simpler.
 + "Per Cent" caption should be placed within the graph.
 + "Source" and "Note" bellow the charts are not aligned, in terms of format.


## 3. Alternative suggestion of the graph

### 3.1. Sktechs of graphical presentation and advantages

#### 1) Sketch1 - Dashboard
+ After finding several issues in clarity and aesthetic, we can design a new dashboard to show the survey result clearly. Bellow the left side chart clearly shows that average scores of answers comparing countries. Also the right side chart clearly shows that not only the % of strongly agreed to a certain answer, but also confidence interval ranges.

#### 2) Sketch2 - Tooltip
+ The dataset contains several important attributes, such as gender, week answered, and employment status. Bellow charts are also important that show how the answers are organised. These charts will be displayed when the you hover over to the previous dashboard graph.

## 4. Step-by-step preparation of visualization 

### 4.1. Preparation for data sets

Some individual country files are compressed, so you have to decompress them in csv format.

### 4.2. Upload raw data set in Tableau
After decompressing all files, data sets are needed to be imported to Tableau.

1. In order to union all the 30 individual country csv files, you need to remove pre-set data set(germany.csv). Then, drag and drop "New Union" to the pane. Next, select all the csv files on the next and drag into the dialog box.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/1Union.png){width=70%}

2. For the purpose of the analysis, we need to hide unnecessary fields first. Click "Manage Metadata" button then select unnecessary fields. Next, right click and hit "Hide". Leave required fields only as below.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/2_2. leave necessary items.png){width=70%}

3. Change name of field of "Table Name" to "Country". Then click  "Aliases" and exclude '.csv'. in all Values on the right side.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/3Edit Table Name aliases excluding csv and change name of field to Country.png){width=70%}

4. After changing all the name of fields regarding questions, select all the six question fields and right click to pivot the values.

5. Then change pivoted fields' name to "Question" and "Score".

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/4_2 pivoted name change.png){width=50%}

6. Click "Create Group.." in "Age" field. Select all the age instances that you want to group and click "Group" button.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/6 Make age group.png){width=70%}

7. Go to Sheet1 and drag and drop "Score" into "Filters" pane. Un-check Null values in Score because the values are not necessary to visualise.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/7_1. go to sheet.png){width=70%}

### 4.3. Upload cleaned data set in Tableau and create necessary calculated fields for analysis

1. Open new tableau file and connect to the extracted file created above. 

2. Create "Answer" field using "created calculated field" function as below. By using letters not digits, users may not be confused easily.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/9 Create Answer created calculated field.png){width=70%}

3. It is more intuitive to express positive responses in high numbers. So, change all the score values in reverse order, using "created calculated field" function

### 4.4. Create gantt chart to show the survey results

We need to make a chart so that we can easily recognize the results of the survey at a glance. In order to compare the proportion of respondents easily, we can divide axes and compare them at the same time.

1. Create "Negative Score Values" field, using "created calculated field" function. Note that you should use CNT to calculate the whole number of respondents.

### 4.5. Create Confidence Interval chart

The number of respondents are different among countries. Therefore, we cannot confidently say that the average scores of answers we have created above reflect correctly the opinion of whole country. For this reason, we can show the "confidence interval range" to give the better information to users. Based on the formula, when the number of sample increases, the range of confidence interval shorten.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/confidence interval.jpg){width=70%}

1. First of all, we need to create 7 calculated field to visualise confidence level. The formula for the fields are below.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/CI_field.png){width=70%}

## 5. Major observations 

Labaging

### 5.1. Changes of the share of residents population
- As illustrated in the statement in original chart, the share of senior population is getting larger than before.
