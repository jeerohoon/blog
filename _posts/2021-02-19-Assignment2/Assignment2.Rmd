## 1. Overview

This post will show how to visualise the result of surveys regarding how people think about Covid-19 vaccination around the world. The original data can be found at [Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker)
Firstly, we will criticize the original charts then show how to make better visualization from the same data set.

- Original chart

![Figure0 : Original visualisation](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/Original.png)

In this GitHub page, below information and data files were used for analysis.

- [README.md](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/README.md)
- codebook of the core questionnaire [codebook.xlsx](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/codebook.xlsx)
- list of countries with data [countries.csv](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/blob/master/countries.csv)
- individual country files with respondent-level data [data/country-name.csv](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/tree/master/data)


## 2. Critique of the original charts

### 2.1. Clarity

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/y.1.png){width=70%}

- This chart is a visualisation for a question "If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it". However, the title of this only show the answer of the question. We need to show proper title to clarify the result.
- This chart is sorted by country name in alphabetical order. Users cannot figure out which country is more pro-vaccine. 
- Users cannot tell which country is most pro-vaccine or not because the results are visualised using 100% stack bars. It is difficult to show using stack bars, because users should compare all the sizes and values line by line.
- There is no indicator to compare and sort. We need to create a new value to compare among countries properly.
- There is a typo error in the title 'pro-vacinne'. It need to be changed to 'pro-vaccine'.
- "% of Total Record", the title of x-axis should be changed to "Percentage of Total Reocrd"

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/y.2.png){width=70%}

- As we seen above, this chart also regarding a question "If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it". However, the title of this only show the answer of the question. We need to show proper title to clarify the result.
- With this chart, we cannot see how many of respondents replied to the survey. Therefore, it is hard to say that percent of people in Sweden is higher than that in Canada, in terms of Confidence interval. We need to show the total number of respondents by country to show the result for clarity.


### 2.2. Aesthetics

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/y.1.png){width=70%}

- This chart used 5 different color to show the proportion of each answer. However, the colors are not consistent to show the scale of answers. We need to use the color scheme wisely, grouping the similar sentiment
- All the countries have lowercase letters. We need to change first letter of country name.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/y.2.png){width=70%}

- We can see a number of countries in a form of bar chart with white background color, so it is not easy to compare by countries. We need to shade each rows to differentiate results.
- The numbers in x-axis have decimal point. We can eliminate all decimal points which are not needed.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/y.3.png){width=50%}

- The title of legend is not appropriate, because users cannot understand properly with 'Vac 1'.
- The legend for the charts only shows the scale of 1 and 5. To make the legend clearer, we need to show all the proper title of the legend


## 3. Alternative suggestion of the graph

### 3.1. Sktechs of graphical presentation and advantages

#### 1) Sketch1 - Dashboard

- After finding several issues in clarity and aesthetic, we can design a new dashboard to show the survey result clearly. Below the left side chart clearly shows that average scores of answers comparing countries. Also the right side chart clearly shows that not only the percentage of respondents "strongly agreed" to a question, but also confidence interval ranges. 
* Note that in final dashboard, we will add the total number of respondents by country next to the "% of strongly agreed to vaccination" chart.
- As seen below, we can put question filter upper position so that users can easily see what about the chart trying to show. Also we can locate legend of "Answer" and "Scale of answer" to show users to see easily.  

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/sketch.png){width=100%}

#### 2) Sketch2 - Tooltips

- The dataset contains several important attributes, such as gender, age, answered week, and employment status. Below charts are also important that show how the answers are organised. These charts will be displayed when the you hover over to the previous dashboard graph.
- By showing the detailed answers by different sub-categories, users can understand easily which factors were affected to the results. 
- Also, we can add 'Average score' through the chart to compare easily by the sub-categories.
- Lastly, we can also include exact numbers of the results, which are hard to show in main dashboard due to space limitation.

### 3.2. Final dashboard of visualisation using Tableau.

All the charts we designed above were rearranged for one cleaned dashboard

## 4. Step-by-step preparation of visualization 

### 4.1. Preparation for data sets

Some individual country files are compressed, so you have to decompress them in csv format.

### 4.2. Upload raw data set in Tableau
After decompressing all files, data sets are needed to be imported to Tableau.

1. In order to union all the 30 individual country csv files, you need to remove pre-set data set(germany.csv). Then, drag and drop "New Union" to the pane. Next, select all the csv files on the next and drag into the dialog box.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/1Union.png){width=70%}

2. For the purpose of the analysis, we need to hide unnecessary fields first. Click "Manage Metadata" button then select unnecessary fields. Next, right click and hit "Hide". Leave required fields only as below.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/2Hide unnessarary fields.png){width=70%}
![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/2_2. leave necessary items.png){width=70%}

3. Change name of field of "Table Name" to "Country". Then click  "Aliases" and exclude '.csv'. in all Values on the right side.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/3Edit Table Name aliases excluding csv and change name of field to Country.png){width=70%}

4. After changing all the name of fields regarding questions, select all the six question fields and right click to pivot the values.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/4 After changing name of questions fields, pivoting.png){width=70%}

5. Then change pivoted fields' name to "Question" and "Score".

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/4_2 pivoted name change.png){width=50%}

6. Click "Create Group.." in "Age" field. Select all the age instances that you want to group and click "Group" button.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/6 Make age group.png){width=70%}

7. Go to Sheet1 and drag and drop "Score" into "Filters" pane. Un-check Null values in Score because the values are not necessary to visualise.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/7_1. go to sheet.png){width=70%}
![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/7 Exclude Null values in Score.png){width=70%}

8. Click "Analysis" > "View data" menue and click "Extract All" to get necessary data.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/8 Click View data and extract necessary dataset.png){width=70%}

### 4.3. Upload cleaned data set in Tableau and create necessary calculated fields for analysis

1. Open new tableau file and connect to the extracted file created above. 

2. Create "Answer" field using "created calculated field" function as below. By using letters not digits, users may not be confused easily.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/9 Create Answer created calculated field.png){width=70%}

3. It is more intuitive to express positive responses in high numbers. So, change all the score values in reverse order, using "created calculated field" function

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/10 Score(int) change the values.png){width=70%}

### 4.4. Create gantt chart to show the survey results

We need to make a chart so that we can easily recognize the results of the survey at a glance. In order to compare the proportion of respondents easily, we can divide axes and compare them at the same time.

1. Create "Negative Score Values" field, using "created calculated field" function. Note that you should use CNT to calculate the whole number of respondents.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/11 Create Negative Score Values.png){width=70%}

2. Create "Total Negative Scores" field using "created calculated field" function. You should click "Default Table Calculation" menu and change "Comute using" from Automatic to Answer.

### 4.5. Create Confidence Interval chart

The number of respondents are different among countries. Therefore, we cannot confidently say that the average scores of answers we have created above reflect correctly the opinion of whole country. For this reason, we can show the "confidence interval range" to give the better information to users. Based on the formula, when the number of sample increases, the range of confidence interval shorten.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/confidence interval.jpg){width=70%}

1. First of all, we need to create 7 calculated field to visualise confidence level. The formula for the fields are below.

![](/Users/1109103/Google Drive/SMU_2021_1st/Visual/blog/_posts/2021-02-19-Assignment2/capture/CI_field.png){width=70%}

>
> IF [Answer]="Strongly agree" THEN [CNT] ELSE 0 END

> 2.. (CI) % of Strongly agree
>
> SUM([(CI) No of Strongly agree])/SUM([CNT])

> 3.. (CI) Z_95%
>
> 1.959964

> 4.. (CI) Prop_SE

> [(CI) % of Strongly agree] + [(CI) Prop_margin of Error 95%]

> 7.. (CI) Prop_Lower Limit 95%
>
> [(CI) % of Strongly agree] - [(CI) Prop_margin of Error 95%]
